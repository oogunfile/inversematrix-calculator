# Inverse Matrix Calculator

## Description
This repository contains a C++ implementation for calculating the inverse of a square matrix. The program is designed with efficiency in mind and utilizes optimized algorithms for matrix operations. It's intended for educational purposes, showcasing algorithmic implementation and can be used as a component in larger systems where matrix inversion is required. In this project, LU decomposition was used to find the inverse of a matrix. L is the lower triangle of a matrix and U is the upper triangle of the matrix. It is worth noting that P is a permutation matrix. 



## Features
- Efficient inverse matrix computation
- Error handling for non-invertible matrices
- Detailed comments explaining the algorithmic steps

## Getting Started

## Dependencies
- C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later standards. GCC or Clang are recommended. Verify your compiler version supports C++11, as this is essential for successful compilation of the code.



### Installing
- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inverse-matrix.git`
- Navigate to the cloned directory

### Executing program
- Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler like g++ main.cpp -o matrixInverse
- Run the executable `./matrix`
